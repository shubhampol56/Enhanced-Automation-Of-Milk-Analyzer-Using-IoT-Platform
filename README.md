# Enhanced Automation Of Milk Analyzer Using IoT Platform
 In this project we plan to develop a low cost upgrade to the existing Milk analyzer machine and connect the small VMCâ€™s together to create a efficient network for improving the quality of milk.We replaced the traditionally used computer system with a raspberry pi 3 which will provide portability.The project is based on IoT and replace the currently used software application(stand-alone) by a web application to provide transparency throughout the Hierarchy.
